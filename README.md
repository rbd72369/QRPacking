# QRPacking

  QRPacking is a personal project that I started because my family was packing a bunch of stuff and storing it in the basement.
The problem with packing a bunch of boxes is that when you want to find something, it becomes quite the chore of opening multiple boxes
to find the things you are looking for even if the boxes are labled. QRPacking solves this problem by allowing users to see exactly what is 
in each packed box without having to open it. 

  QRPacking turns photos into QR codes. A user takes a photo of the packed box and types a description. 
Then the user can choose to print out the QR code and description and tape it to the box.
When someone want to see what they packed in a box, they just have to scan the QR code and a photo of the boxes contents pops up.
A very simple concept and application that will save many a househould countless headaches.
